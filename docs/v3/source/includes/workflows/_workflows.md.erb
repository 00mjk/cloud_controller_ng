# Workflows

Many users will think of interactions with Cloud Foundry in terms of a single operation like `cf push` in order to upload an application to the platform, have it compiled, and schedule it to be run.
Performing a push operation actually requires a client to orchestrate several requests to the API to accomplish the entire operation.
This section is meant to explain how clients can perform complex workflows using the API.

## Push V2 App and Run a V3 Task

As of CF-245, a V2 Application is also available as a V3 Application, allowing a user to run a V3 Task against it.
Given a V2 Application with guid `4443bff6-69cf-46d6-96b8-d311aeda3567`, create a V3 Task with a POST request to `/v3/apps/4443bff6-69cf-46d6-96b8-d311aeda3567/tasks`.
