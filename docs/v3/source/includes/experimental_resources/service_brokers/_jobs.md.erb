### Service Broker Jobs

CRUD operations for service brokers are asynchronous. `create`, `update` and `delete` endpoints return urls to `jobs` in the `Location` header of the HTTP response.

These jobs are the only source of information about the progress and end state of the operation. Therefore, the job must be polled to find out when the process ends and if it was successful.
It's also worth noting that there is no mechanism to link a service broker with its jobs, apart from the `Location` header in the API response.

When a failure occurs during a create job, then the service broker won't be usable. However it will still be included in the `GET` endpoints responses, hence the importance of querying the job to find out the end status.

When updating a service broker, the changes will be rollbacked in the event the job fails. The service broker will remain unchanged with no indication that the update operation failed. Querying the job will provide such information.
