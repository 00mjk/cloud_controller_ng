## Resource Matches

This endpoint matches given resource SHA-1 / file size pairs against the Cloud Controller cache,
and reports the subset that describes already cached files.
This is usually used to avoid uploading duplicate files
when pushing an app which has only been partially changed.
Cloud Foundry operators may set minimum / maximum file sizes to match against.
If the file size provided is outside this range,
it will not be matched against.
