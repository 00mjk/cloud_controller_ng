### The destination object

A destination represents the relationship between a route and a resource that can serve traffic (e.g. the `web` process
of an application).

When a route has destinations, that route will direct traffic to the processes represented by those destinations.

```
Example Destination object
```
```json
<%= yield_content :single_destination %>
```
