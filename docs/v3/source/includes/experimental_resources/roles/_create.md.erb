This endpoint creates a new role for an existing user in an organization or space.

To create an organization role you must be an admin or organization manager in the organization associated with the role.

To create a space role you must be an admin, an organization manager in the parent organization of the space associated with the role, or a space manager in the space associated with the role.

For a user to be assigned a space role, the user must already have an organization role in the parent organization.
